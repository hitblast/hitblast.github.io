So, in a bold move driven by sheer boredom and the urge to try new things, I've decided to install the macOS 26 Tahoe Developer Beta.

This might sound like a little bit of a "downgrade" to my workflow, since, we all know Apple ships incomplete features which often glitch out a lot, and my development pipeline could've been affected by it. Even I was skeptical of the user experience at first, seeing all the controversy surrounding the "Liquid Glass" refresh macOS has gotten recently. And, to be honest, I think this is all *partially* true?

However, I actually like a couple of things. I still have a lot to say about the design, so I will talk about that during the end. So, back to the point:

macOS Tahoe is a design refresh attempt from Apple which, in their wordings, tries to "redefine" what human interactivity with hardware and software looks like. Taking in for account the blazing fast speed of Apple Silicon, I think they can really take the juice out of the built-in hardware of their products in search of a fluid experience.

A ***lot*** of things got upgraded. Which includes:

- **Apple Intelligence**, but it is still an unfinished product, so it's the topic of a different entry entirely.
- **Live Translation**, which is probably the king feature that Apple's been hyping up since WWDC.
- **Spotlight Search**, and personally, I quite like this one.
- **Design**, which not only includes the Liquid Glass refresh, it also modifies how icons are handled, how window borders look across the board, and so many more things.
- ... and so much more.
