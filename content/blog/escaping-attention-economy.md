## A short read

Long story short, this almost NEVER happens without brute force.

I recently took the initiative to make my phone boring, and you may have read about it in the [last blog entry](../unlocking-mi-bootloader), and ever since that ended successfully, I've been having a whole new experience with how I experience my daily life as a student and developer.

Generally speaking, I am hooked to my devices like any other person in this age. Continuous scrolling, aimless procrastination is a day job at this point; only difference? There's no incentive.

Time's the incentive we're talking about, but instead of gaining more of it, we lose it. The time we could've otherwise given to our loved ones, is going to fuel corporate algorithm machines spitting out slop every once in a while at our face.

Attention runs the modern world, and its sad to see people getting forced into it. I mean this was bound to happen anyway, have you ever read a ToS properly?

## Some suggestions

Well hey, I'm not your personal YouTube feed but, I found some pretty cool resourcees regarding the attention economy to get you into flow with what I'm trying to talk about here. These videos are by [Nathan Laundry](https://www.youtube.com/@nathanlaundry/videos) and he has become one of my favorite creators who specifically highlights self-hosting and the more DIY parts of life:

## Taking the first step: cut Google

Since I had to solve my attention problem, all I could think of at the first is how to kill the roots of it. So, I decided to remove Google out of the equation (could've backfired very easily if I were using banking apps).

Also, some things you may/may not already know:

- Google runs **YouTube**, one of the best players against Instagram and TikTok for showing shortform content if not the best already. You scroll, you train the algorithm what to feed you, and it just becomes a self-feeding while loop of mental slop over time.
- Google generates its primary revenue from **ads**, and if your phone manufacturer notoriously bakes in trackers and ads into your system apps (literally), you'll benefit quite a lot from removing them.
- Brain's a feedback loop. Removing one will encourage you to remove the other platforms as well.

I'm not saying YouTube is bad, we'll come to that part later.

#### Alternatives:

- I installed an open-source implementation of Google Play Services called [microG Services](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore) since I still need to run some apps which may require Google Play Services. Specific guidance may be required for certain smartphones.
- I replaced Play Store with [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com) in order to safely block out the trackers without losing access to all of my favorite apps.
- I also downloaded an additional app store named [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) for easily installing open-source apps.
- I did NOT replace YouTube since I want to cut that part off.
- For Gmail, I've installed [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/). Looks sleek, and does the job for viewing my emails and not promotions in the homepage.

The good part about LineageOS is, I do not have to fiddle around with Google-backed system apps like Phone, Contacts or Messaging. All of them come factory with LineageOS without the Google Part.

## Social media

Now comes the true part of the attention economy which I never thought would harm me so bad.

I am an admission-seeker, meaning that I'm having to study for entering into my higher studies for getting accepted by a reputed university. This is common practice in my country post-college.
